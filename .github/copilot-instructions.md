# GitHub Copilot Instructions — ha-petkit

This file provides persistent context for GitHub Copilot so it understands the project
without needing to re-learn the codebase on every session.

---

## Project Overview

**ha-petkit** is a Home Assistant custom integration that connects to Petkit water fountains
locally via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It uses Home Assistant's native Bluetooth stack,
supporting both local adapters and ESPHome Bluetooth proxies transparently.

- **Repo**: https://github.com/aavdberg/ha-petkit
- **Domain**: `petkit_ble`
- **HA minimum version**: 2024.1
- **Python target**: 3.12
- **Linter**: ruff (configured in `pyproject.toml`)

## BLE Protocol

### GATT Characteristics
- **Write UUID**: `0000aaa2-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (write-without-response)
- **Notify UUID**: `0000aaa1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`

### Frame Format
```
[0xFA, 0xFC, 0xFD, cmd, type, seq, data_len, 0x00, ...payload..., 0xFB]
```

### Authentication Sequence (every connection)
1. **CMD 213** — request device ID (big-endian for CMD 73 payload)
2. **CMD 73** — register a fresh random 8-byte secret: `device_id_be + random_8_bytes`
3. **CMD 86** — verify the same secret; response[0] must equal `1` for success
4. **CMD 84** — set device time (Petkit epoch: 2000-01-01, offset = 946684800)

**Why always full re-init (CMD 73 every connection):** CMD 86 returns `response[0]=1`
("success") even with a stale or wrong secret — it is a false positive. The device only
enters an authenticated session if CMD 73 was sent first in the current connection.
Skipping CMD 73 causes CMD 200/210 to be silently ignored. Running CMD 73 on every
connection makes the integration immune to the iOS app (or any other BLE client)
resetting the device's auth state.

### CTW3 Authentication Note
CMD 73 uses the device_id from CMD 213 converted to big-endian; followed by a new
`secrets.token_bytes(8)` generated per connection. No fixed/hardcoded values needed.

### Key Commands
| CMD | Direction | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| 213 | Read | Device ID |
| 73  | Read | Challenge bytes |
| 86  | Write | Auth secret |
| 84  | Write | Set device time |
| 210 | Read | Device state (ALL devices; CTW3 returns 26 bytes, W4/W5/CTW2 return 12 bytes) |
| 211 | Read | Device config (DND times, LED, smart-mode on/off duration) — CTW3 only |
| 66  | Read | Battery / ADC voltage |
| 200 | Read | Firmware + hardware version |
| 220 | Write | Power on/off / mode |
| 222 | Write | Reset filter |

### State Payload Layout
- **W4/W5/CTW2** (CMD 210): 12+ bytes, big-endian
- **CTW3** (CMD 210): 26+ bytes — has `suspend_status`, `electric_status`, `battery_level`, `detect_status`
  (CTW3 uses the **same CMD 210** as other devices, just with an extended 26-byte payload)

## Calculated Sensor Values

### Filter Days Remaining
```python
if mode == 1:
    days = ceil(filter_pct / 100 * 60)
elif mode == 2:
    days = ceil((filter_pct / 100 * 30) * (on + off) / on)
```

### Water Purified Today (liters)
```python
divisor = {CTW3: 3.0, W5C: 1.0, W4X: 1.8}.get(alias, 2.0)
liters = (flow_rate_lpm * pump_runtime_today_min / 60) / divisor
```

### Energy Today (kWh)
```python
power_w = 0.182 if alias == W5C else 0.75
kwh = power_w * pump_runtime_min / 60 / 1000
```

## HA Integration Patterns Used

- **`async_ble_device_from_address(hass, address, connectable=True)`** — transparently
  routes BLE connections through ESPHome Bluetooth proxies; no special proxy handling needed.
- **`DataUpdateCoordinator`** — 60-second polling interval; raises `UpdateFailed` on errors.
- **`entry.runtime_data`** — stores the coordinator instance (modern HA pattern, HA 2024.1+).
- **`async_step_bluetooth()`** — triggered automatically by HA when a matching BLE device
  is seen (matchers defined in `manifest.json` under the `bluetooth` key).
- **`CoordinatorEntity`** — all platform entities inherit from `PetkitBleEntity`.

## Device Alias Detection (from BLE Name)

Order matters — check more specific aliases first:
```
W4XUVC → W4X UVC
W4X    → W4X
W5C    → W5C
W5N    → W5N
W5     → W5
CTW3   → CTW3
CTW2   → CTW2
```

### Marketing Name ↔ BLE Name Mapping

| BLE Advertisement Name | Product (marketing name) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Petkit_CTW2_*` | Eversweet Solo 2 | Wireless, AC only, smaller |
| `Petkit_CTW3_*` | Eversweet Max 2 (Cordless) | Wireless + AC, battery, 26-byte CMD 210 |
| `Petkit_W5C_*` | Eversweet 3 Pro | AC only |
| `Petkit_W5N_*` | Eversweet 3 | AC only |
| `Petkit_W5_*` | Eversweet (original) | AC only |
| `Petkit_W4X_*` | Eversweet W4X | AC only |
| `Petkit_W4XUVC_*` | Eversweet W4X UVC | AC only, UV-C sterilisation |

> **Note:** "CTW" is Petkit's internal hardware revision code, independent of the consumer
> product name. The number in CTW2/CTW3 is a **hardware revision**, not a product generation.
> Example: Eversweet Max 2 uses hardware revision CTW3; Eversweet Solo 2 uses CTW2.

## Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Production — HACS users install from here; auto GitHub Release on merge |
| `dev` | Development & testing — all features merge here first |
| `feature/*` | Individual features — PR to `dev` |
| `fix/*` | Bug fixes — PR to `dev` |
| `chore/*` | Non-code changes (docs, CI, deps) — PR to `dev` |

Both `main` and `dev` are protected: PRs required, ruff lint must pass.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE — Always follow this workflow:
```
git checkout dev && git pull
git checkout -b fix/my-fix          # or feature/, chore/
# make changes
git add ... && git commit -m "fix: ..."
git push -u origin fix/my-fix
gh pr create --base dev --head fix/my-fix --title "..." --body "..."
# wait for CI to pass, then merge
```

**NEVER commit or push directly to `dev` or `main`.**  
Even as admin (bypassed protection), direct pushes skip CI and break the audit trail.
Every change — no matter how small — must go through a PR to `dev`.

---

## Code Conventions

- **Language**: All code comments, docstrings, commit messages, and documentation in **English**.
- **Python**: 3.12+, type hints required, `from __future__ import annotations` in every module.
- **Imports**: Use `from collections.abc import Callable` (not `from typing import Callable`).
- **Linter**: ruff — run `ruff check custom_components/` before committing.
- **Commit style**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `refactor:`).
- **Translations**: Add keys to `strings.json` first, then mirror to all `translations/*.json`.
- **New sensors**: Add to `sensor.py` description list + `strings.json` + all translation files.
- **No direct push to `main` or `dev`** — always use a PR.

## Known Issues / Quirks

- CTW3 always uses `[0]*6` as device_id in auth — see `ble_client.py` L270-283.
- HACS brands asset (`custom_components/petkit_ble/brand/icon.png`) not yet provided;
  currently relies on fallback check in brands repository.
- Cloud coordinator not yet implemented — only local BLE supported.
- ruff `UP035`: always import `Callable` from `collections.abc`, not `typing`.
